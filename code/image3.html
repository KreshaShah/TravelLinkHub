People have become so much passionate about travelling that we read many of them even quit their job for accomplishing their dream see the light. It is more like an adventure for them, exploring new places, meeting new people, getting to know and learn the new culture from other countries, tribes and even neighbouring states. The expense involved is never a concern for them.

We recently read news on a couple who had quit their job to travel the world but, finally landed up scrubbing the loo and that too for money! Chanel Cartell and Stevo Dirnberger had quit their advertising jobs to follow their dream of travelling around the world. But, people were quite alarmed to see a blog post by Cartell which she posted recently. It said that she wanted to share the uglier side of their trip after six months. They landed up bankrupt and now scrub the loo for pay, to earn a living! That sounds so scary indeed!!



Now, that is something we need to foresee before we plan our journey. Things won't be simple once the journey is set. Now, all these matters for people who are like avid travellers. If you are a person who would like to explore the world on a minimal note, you have plenty of ways to save money on each trip that you do including your tickets, food and even accommodation. Online travel websites play a key role in this factor.<br>
